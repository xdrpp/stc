# Stellar transaction compiler

stc is a library and command-line tool for creating, editing, and
manipulating transactions for the [Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/)
blockchain.  It supports translating back and forth between
human-readable [txrep] format and Stellar's native binary XDR
representation, as well submitting transactions to the network,
querying account status, and more.  The library makes it easy to build
and submit transactions programmatically from go applications.

# Installing `stc` for non-developers

To install or upgrade this software if you don't plan to hack on it,
run the following two commands (assuming your GOPATH is in the default
location of `~/go`):

    rm -rf ~/go/src/github.com/xdrpp/stc
    go get github.com/xdrpp/stc/...

The `rm` command is necessary when upgrading because [some `go get`
limitation](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/27526) leaves your
tree in a detached state, so that `go get -u` cannot pull from the
remote `go1` branch.

Once this command completes, put the `~/go/bin` directory on your path
and you should be able to run `stc`.

To install the software from within a go module (a directory with a
`go.mod` file), you will need to specify the `go1` branch to get
autogenerated files.  Do so by running:

    go get github.com/xdrpp/stc/...@go1

# Using `stc`

See the [stc(1)][stc.1] man page for the command-line tool.

See the [godoc documentation][gh-pages] for the library.  Because
`stc` contains auto-generated source files that are not on the master
branch in git, it is best to view the documentation locally, rather
than through on-line godoc viewers that will not show you the correct
branch.  To view godoc, after installing `stc` with `go get` as
described above, start a local godoc server and open it in your
browser as follows:

    godoc -index -http localhost:6060 &
    xdg-open http://localhost:6060/pkg/github.com/xdrpp/stc

On MacOS computers, run `open` instead of `xdg-open`, or just paste
the URL into your browser.

# Building `stc` for developers

Because `stc` requires autogenerated files, the `master` branch is not
meant to be compiled under `$GOPATH`, but rather in a standalone
directory with `make`.

Furthermore, to build `stc` from the master branch, you also need to
have the [`goxdr`](https://github.com/xdrpp/goxdr) compiler.  Because
`stc` is codeveloped with goxdr, you may want to use a development
version of `goxdr`, which you can do by placing a the `goxdr` source
tree (or a symbolic link to it) in `cmd/goxdr`.  If you don't want to
do this, but are okay just using a snapshot of `goxdr`, you can run:

    make depend

Once you have `goxdr`, you can build `stc` by running:

    make

To install `stc`, you will also need [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to
format the man page.

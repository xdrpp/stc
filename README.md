# Stellar transaction compiler

stc is a command-line tool that translates
[Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/) blockchain transactions back and
forth between human-readable
[txrep](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0011.md)
format and Stellar's native binary XDR representation.  With stc, you
can create, view, edit, sign, and submit Stellar transactions.

# Installing `stc` for non-developers

To install or upgrade this software if you don't plan to hack on it,
run the following two commands (assuming your GOPATH is in the default
location of `~/go`):

    rm -rf ~/go/src/github.com/xdrpp/stc/
    go get github.com/xdrpp/stc/...

The `rm` command is necessary when upgrading because [some `go get`
limitation](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/27526) leaves your
tree in a detached state, so that `go get -u` cannot pull from the
remote `go1` branch.

Once this completes, put the `~/go/bin` directory on your path and you
should be able to run `stc`.

If you'd like to install just the `goxdr` XDR compiler, you can also
run:

    go get github.com/xdrpp/stc/cmd/goxdr

# Using `stc`

See the [man page](stc.1.md)

# Building `stc` for developers

Because `stc` requires autogenerated files, the `master` branch is not
meant to be compiled under `$GOPATH`, but rather in a standalone
directory with a `make`.

Furthermore, to build `stc` you also need to install `goyacc` and the
Go extra `crypto` library.  If you don't already have these installed,
or if your versions are too old, run the following command:

    make update-depend

to install the build-type dependencies under your `$GOPATH` (`~/go` by
default).  Once these dependencies are place, just run:

    make

to build the tool.  If that doesn't work, you may have an old version
of the extra `crypto` library, so make sure to run `make
update-depend`.

To install `stc`, you will also need [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to
format the man page.

To understand the included `goxdr` XDR compiler, see its [man
page](cmd/goxdr/goxdr.1.md).
